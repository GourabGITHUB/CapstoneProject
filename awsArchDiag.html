<h2> <ol>
	This is a 3 tier architecture solution for hosting a web application that receives client requests and uses MySQL to query data and send it back to client.
</ol>
</h2>
<hr>
<p> <ul>
The web application will be deployed to <b>EC2</b>, we will create 1 <b>VPC</b> with 2 public subnets and 4 private subnets.
we will place two <b>EC2</b>instances inside a public subnet which will serve the front end interface or web tier of the architecture, we will be using multiple instances with two availability zones for more redundancy.
<p>
we will create two more identical <b>EC2</b>instances in <b>Auto Scaling Group</b> to provide horizontal scalability during high traffic by adding instances as required, we can configure with a maximum 4 instances with desired of 3 and minimum 2 instances .</p>
<p>
<b>Application Load Balancer</b> will be used to distribute traffic to <b>EC2</b>instances, we will configure security groups with all the resources to control inbound and outbound traffic and manage permissions.
we will create <b>Auto Scaling Group</b> with application and data tier independently </p>
<p>
For database we will be using <b>RDS MySQL</b> database, this will be running on a different instance than application tier and will replicate data in the second availability zone. </p>
<p>
We will use <b>CloudWatch</b> service for monitoring and optimizing resources, since we are using <b>Auto Scaling Group</b>, <b>CloudWatch</b> can monitor the instance usage and send alerts to <b>Auto Scaling Group</b> for adding instances and <b>Application Load Balancer</b> will then run health check and then new instances can receive traffic.
</ul>
